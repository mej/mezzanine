0.  Introduction and Quick Start
--------------------------------

This document is intended as a brief overview of the new Software
Engineering build system:  how it works, how to use it, and some of the
design philosophies behind it.  It also details the various standards
policies which govern its contents, so those planning on adding and/or
maintaining its contents should read those sections carefully.

Before you can build any products, you must set your machine up to be
able to run the build system tools.  Since you are reading this README
file, you must have checked out the "base" module.  Within that module
is a directory called "pm" which contains another directory called
"getopt."  This getopt directory contains the Getopt::Mixed Perl module
which is required for the build scripts to function properly.  You will
need to go into pm/getopt as root and run the following command as
root:  "perl Makefile.PL ; make ; make install".  Once you have done
this, return to the base directory and proceed as shown below.

For those wishing to simply build a particular VA product, you will
find a directory called products under this one.  It contains a series
of files with .prod extensions.  Find the file with the name of the
product you wish to build, then invoke the following command at your
shell prompt:

$ ./buildtool -p <product>

...where <product> is the name of the product file, but without the
.prod on the end.  This command should be run by your regular user
account (not root) and should be run from the directory which contains
buildtool and this README file.  Executing this command will build all
packages associated with that product, both binary and source packages.
If you wish to build ISO images as well, use -bi as well as -p.

The following sections will have more detailed information on how to
use the system, so if you are going to be involved in the actual day-
to-day maintenance of the system or any packages within the system,
keep reading!

1.  Overall Philosophy
----------------------

The build system is designed on two basic concepts:  the "product" and
the "package."  A "product" is a collection of packages which form some
coherent entity when you put them all together, such as a distribution.
A "package" is the basic unit which the build system must know how to
take from its "source" form and generate its "target" form.  Take care
not to confuse this term with "package file."  Although a package can
take the form of a package file, like an SRPM, not all packages are
package files, nor are all package files packages.

In general, the build system works with two basic types of packages.
Some packages are modified by VA before being included in our
enhanced distribution(s), while others are taken directly from RedHat
or some other source.  The build system must be able to seamlessly
handle both these cases.  For the latter case, the packages are simply
kept as SRPM's, and buildtool knows how to explode the SRPM and build
from the exploded sources.

The former case is much more complicated.  Packages which are modified
internally by VA are stored as directory trees containing the source,
the necessary spec files, and any other files required by the build
process.  These directory trees will hereafter be referred to by their
proper term in revision control lingo, "modules."

Two tools are employed as user-level interfaces to this system.  The
first, called "revtool," handles all interaction with the revision
control system.  It encapsulates all revision control system-specific
commands and gives them an interface which is independent of the
underlying system.  Thus, if the repository was moved from CVS to, say,
BitKeeper, revtool's code would change, but its interface would remain
the same.

The second tool is "buildtool," mentioned briefly above.  buildtool is
what takes a product name/version pair, like "va-redhat-6.2.1" and
translates that via a series of product definition/configuration files
("prod files" for short) into a set of packages to build.  It then
builds those packages, creating both source and binary package files.
It can also build ISO images for CD's from these packages and some
template modules.
