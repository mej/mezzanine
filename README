0.  Introduction and Quick Start
--------------------------------

This document is intended as a brief overview of the new Software
Engineering build system:  how it works, how to use it, and some of the
design philosophies behind it.  It also details the various standards
policies which govern its contents, so those planning on adding and/or
maintaining its contents should read those sections carefully.

For those wishing to simply build a particular VA product, you will
find a directory called products under this one.  It contains a series
of files with .prod extensions.  Find the file with the name of the
product you wish to build, then invoke the following command at your
shell prompt:

$ ./buildtool -bp -p <product>

...where <product> is the name of the product file, but without the
.prod on the end.  This command should be run by your regular user
account (not root) and should be run from the directory which contains
buildtool and this README file.  Executing this command will build all
packages associated with that product, both binary and source packages.
If you wish to build ISO images as well, use -bi instead of -bp.

The following sections will have more detailed information on how to
use the system, so if you are going to be involved in the actual day-
to-day maintenance of the system or any packages within the system,
keep reading!
