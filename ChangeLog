Fri May  5 23:38:07 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added commit support to revtool with automatic log file creation and
automatic updating of the ChangeLog.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:44:04 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added ChangeLog to CVS and added add/remove support to revtool.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:47:49 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Hopefully the ChangeLog will update properly this time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:50:47 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Longer lines needed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:54:48 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

A bit of reformatting on the ChangeLog.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:58:34 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

It would help if I'd learn to count. =P
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  6 00:02:26 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added -R option for recursive removes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  6 00:06:05 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

revtool will automatically add the ChangeLog to the repository if it
has to create it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 18:12:05 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixed a couple small issues with revtool, and added a fallback in case
the user forgets to specify which files to add or remove.  (I did.)
It will now prompt the user to enter a series of filenames or
wildcards, glob them, and pass them on to the add command.  I also am
committing buildtool as it stands thus far (which isn't too far, but
hey...).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 19:54:03 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added a README file.  Right now it's basically bupkis, but it will get
better.  I put in a skeleton of the sections I think we need to flesh
out along with a quick-start intro (that doesn't actually apply yet,
but gives a bit of an idea how it should work long-term).

Feel free to use it as a place to get your ideas down "on paper."
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 20:41:43 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

More stuff for the README.  I'm at a point where I'm not sure about
something, so it's time to throw in the towel for the night and get
comments tomorrow. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 15:28:32 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

buildtool now parses product definition files (.prod files) which
describe products in terms of packages and other products.  It should
be able to resolve a single product into all its component products.
It also has the skeleton of build stages.  The next step is simply to
flesh out those stages.  Then we're done.  (If only it were that
simple.) :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 16:14:02 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added a .prod file for RedHat 6.2.  Time to make the thing build.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 16:50:34 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added -q and -Q options to shut buildtool up if needed, and fixed the
redhat-6.2 product file.  "CVS" is not a package. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 17:12:33 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Timestamping and general stage notices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 22:37:20 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Lots of changes here.  The big deal is that buildtool should be able
to (mostly) bootstrap redhat-6.2 now.  Also, revtool -g works, and I
added some to revtool to make it more flexible WRT adds and removes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 10 21:04:23 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixes to the stuff that happened last night are done, along with the
explode stage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 10 21:09:43 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixed a tiny bug in revtool that kept the new product file from being
added properly.  Doh!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 11 14:57:56 2000                              Craig Ross (ccr)

Commented out packages in va-6.2.1.prod that were removed from
contrib-rh
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 11 19:11:26 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

All the important stages are complete, at least for SRPM's.  I still
have the ISO stage, the cleanup stage, and the compose stage to go,
but it should be to the point where the RedHat 6.2 packages can be
rebuilt and congregated.  Time to test that theory....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 13 01:03:53 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Miscellaneous bug fixes to buildtool.  Getting closer....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 15 17:50:54 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

This should fix that build bug where some packages got excluded from
one stage or another.  The beginnings of the compose stage are here
too.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 15 20:05:59 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

The rest of the compose stage....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 16 17:21:03 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Some cleanups and fine tuning here.  Let's see if this sucker works...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 16 17:33:16 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Doh!  Forgot a bit there.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 20:43:39 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Some additions in error handling for robustness in the face of
stupidity.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 18 21:39:35 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Okay.  Lots of changes here.  Theoretically, the backend work is in
place for handling multiple source tarballs, additional non-tarball
sources, and product variables.  You should also be able to specify
a product file entry on the command line, and buildtool will Do the
Right Thing(tm).  Plus, if a particular package falls into a certain
set of criteria, buildtool will attempt to make reasonable guesses as
to its type without you having to specify (e.g., if it ends in
".src.rpm").  I also added support for several new package variables,
including the ability to have a package skip stages, and to specify
the "tar" and "gzip" commands to be used to build the vendor source
packages.

I also fixed a minor issue revtool had with ChangeLog creation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 18 22:05:11 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

I think this way will be better.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 18 22:37:09 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Exclude dotfiles from additional sources too.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 19 13:19:18 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Okay, first off, I fixed a bug that Walt found in buildtool.  The
base, product, and build directories need to be absolute paths, not
relative ones, if you're going to be building any module packages.

Also, we had the misfortune of realizing that some packages have
tarballs that explode into the current directory, or into multiple
directories.   Ugh.  So I've had to change the syntax from what I
told you last night.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 19 17:29:14 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Implemented a fairly sophisticated product file finder along with
product variable fallbacks for package variables.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 19 17:52:23 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Product files for RedHat stuff.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 20 21:22:49 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Not quite perfect yet, but I wanted to get my changes thus far into
the tree.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 21 14:52:57 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

More tolerances for RPM build errors, plus some corrections for typos
in the product files.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 22 12:44:09 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

The "doc++" name was screwing up one of my regexp's because '+' is a
metacharacter.  Hopefully this will fix it.  We'll find out in about
16 hours.... =P
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 22 19:21:47 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added initial product files for 6.2.2.  These will change quite a bit
over time, of course. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 22 19:22:31 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixity-fix some more bugity-bugs.  Time for another build run.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 23 11:46:59 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Hopefully this will fix the spec file problem for the CVS modules and
the finding of target binary RPM's for the other stuff.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 23 16:40:28 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Looks like I've fixed that "can't find specfile" bug.  I've also added
a variable for specifying the build architecture which will hopefully
keep stuff from choking on i386 vs. i686.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 24 15:38:44 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixed some typos in the product files and got the prep work ready for
parallelizing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 24 19:42:08 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Parallelizing has been added.  Time to see if it works.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 25 11:43:59 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

A few bugs in parallelization fixed.  It works now, but it still needs
some speed improvements.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 25 14:14:07 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

By removing the need to exec itself, buildtool's speed seems to have
just increased by a factor of 6.  Time to try a full build. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 26 13:29:14 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Doh!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
