Added commit support to revtool with automatic log file creation and
automatic updating of the ChangeLog.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:44:04 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added ChangeLog to CVS and added add/remove support to revtool.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:47:49 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Hopefully the ChangeLog will update properly this time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:50:47 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Longer lines needed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:54:48 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

A bit of reformatting on the ChangeLog.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 23:58:34 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

It would help if I'd learn to count. =P
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  6 00:02:26 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added -R option for recursive removes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  6 00:06:05 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

revtool will automatically add the ChangeLog to the repository if it
has to create it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 18:12:05 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixed a couple small issues with revtool, and added a fallback in case
the user forgets to specify which files to add or remove.  (I did.)
It will now prompt the user to enter a series of filenames or
wildcards, glob them, and pass them on to the add command.  I also am
committing buildtool as it stands thus far (which isn't too far, but
hey...).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 19:54:03 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added a README file.  Right now it's basically bupkis, but it will get
better.  I put in a skeleton of the sections I think we need to flesh
out along with a quick-start intro (that doesn't actually apply yet,
but gives a bit of an idea how it should work long-term).

Feel free to use it as a place to get your ideas down "on paper."
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 20:41:43 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

More stuff for the README.  I'm at a point where I'm not sure about
something, so it's time to throw in the towel for the night and get
comments tomorrow. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 15:28:32 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

buildtool now parses product definition files (.prod files) which
describe products in terms of packages and other products.  It should
be able to resolve a single product into all its component products.
It also has the skeleton of build stages.  The next step is simply to
flesh out those stages.  Then we're done.  (If only it were that
simple.) :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 16:14:02 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added a .prod file for RedHat 6.2.  Time to make the thing build.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 16:50:34 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added -q and -Q options to shut buildtool up if needed, and fixed the
redhat-6.2 product file.  "CVS" is not a package. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 17:12:33 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Timestamping and general stage notices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  9 22:37:20 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Lots of changes here.  The big deal is that buildtool should be able
to (mostly) bootstrap redhat-6.2 now.  Also, revtool -g works, and I
added some to revtool to make it more flexible WRT adds and removes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 10 21:04:23 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixes to the stuff that happened last night are done, along with the
explode stage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 10 21:09:43 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixed a tiny bug in revtool that kept the new product file from being
added properly.  Doh!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 11 14:57:56 2000                              Craig Ross (ccr)

Commented out packages in va-6.2.1.prod that were removed from
contrib-rh
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 11 19:11:26 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

All the important stages are complete, at least for SRPM's.  I still
have the ISO stage, the cleanup stage, and the compose stage to go,
but it should be to the point where the RedHat 6.2 packages can be
rebuilt and congregated.  Time to test that theory....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 13 01:03:53 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Miscellaneous bug fixes to buildtool.  Getting closer....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 15 17:50:54 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

This should fix that build bug where some packages got excluded from
one stage or another.  The beginnings of the compose stage are here
too.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 15 20:05:59 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

The rest of the compose stage....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 16 17:21:03 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Some cleanups and fine tuning here.  Let's see if this sucker works...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 16 17:33:16 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Doh!  Forgot a bit there.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 20:43:39 2000                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Some additions in error handling for robustness in the face of
stupidity.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
