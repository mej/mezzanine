How to import a new src.rpm
---------------------------

So you just downloaded foo.src.rpm and need to add it to the repository.
The steps you would follow are:
  
  1) set CVSROOT
  2) use avimport (srctool -i) on the src.rpm

Example:
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:shaleh@cvs.engr:/cvs/Cujo
$ avimport ctcs-1.2.15-1.src.rpm 
Importing ctcs-1.2.15-1.src.rpm into ctcs tree....

  cvs server: Importing /cvs/Cujo/ctcs/S
  N ctcs/S/ctcs-1.2.15.tar.gz
  cvs server: Importing /cvs/Cujo/ctcs/F
  N ctcs/F/ctcs.spec
  
  No conflicts created by this import

As you can see, this results in /path/to/cvsroot/foo/name/{S,F}. S is the
source tarball, F is where the spec file goes.  name is taken from the name
of the src.rpm you imported: in this case 'ctcs'.

How to fix a bug (or add features) to a project
-----------------------------------------------

  1) use avget (revtool -g) to retrieve the new module
  2) use avprep (srctool -p) in the module directory to give you a working
     directory to hack in
  3) use avpatch (srctool -a) to apply your changes from the working directory
  4) use avput (revtool -i) to commit your changes

Example:
$ avget ctcs
cvs server: Updating ctcs
cvs server: Updating ctcs/F
U ctcs/F/ctcs.spec
cvs server: Updating ctcs/S
U ctcs/S/ctcs-1.2.15.tar.gz
$ cd ctcs 
$ avprep
Creating working directory /home/shaleh/va/ctcs/work....
You may now chdir to ctcs/work to make changes.
Use "avpatch -n <patch_name>" to generate a patch when done.
$ cd work
$ ls
ctcs-1.2.15
$ cd ctcs-1.2.15/
<hack hack hack>
$ cd ../.. # must be in the base directory for avpatch to work
$ avpatch -n function.patch # the patch name must be the full filename
Created P/function.patch (21 lines).
Patch added and ready for commit.
$ edit F/ctcs.spec # add the new patch, the avalon tools read this
$ avput
? work

removed all instances of the keyword 'function'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: the '? work' message is safe to ignore, that is cvs telling you it
knows nothing about the directory 'work' which is ok since we do not want it
to.

As you can see, a 'P' directory now exists.  This directory will contain all
of the patches against the source.

A warning: the avalon tools will overwrite the file named on the command line.
So if there had been a function.patch, it would have been removed.  If this
happens to you, simply rename the patch you just created and do:
avget P/foo.patch.  Of course if you had committed your work you will have to
jump through more hoops.


How to make a new tarball for use in Buffy or elsewhere
-------------------------------------------------------

You want to make a minitiature filesystem with packages installed into it for
use by Buffy or for chroot testing.

  1) make a packages file
  2) use imgtool

A packages file is simply a list of packages to install.  The order is
important -- the list must be in dependency order.

A sample of the (somewhat long) file looks like this:
setup
filesystem
basesystem
ldconfig
glibc
mktemp
termcap
libtermcap --nodeps
bash
rootfiles

note the libtermcap entry, you are allowed to pass packaging options.

Example:
$ imgtool -i bob -D /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/:/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 -a bob.tgz -l bob.list

This results in a bob.tgz file which can be uncompressed and chrooted into
or given to the Buffy people for loading on our machines.  The -D takes a
UNIX path style colon separated list.

Eventually, pkgsort will work and you will be able to let it figure out the
depends info.

*NOTE* this creates a directory where you specify and installs the entire
list of packages there.  So, make sure you have the hard drive space.  Also
depending on the speed of you system (I/O and CPU) this could take 10 minutes
to an hour.

How to make a layered product with product files
-------------------------------------------------

Its the buzzword du jour and your boss wants it yesterday, here's how.

  1) make a product file -- see the avalon docs for the deep gory details
  2) use buildtool
  3) (optional) use mediatool to create an ISO

As an example, I will use the Red Hat product.

# Product Definition for VA Linux 7.1.1
name:       va-redhat
version:    7.1.1
arch:       i386
cvsroot:    :pserver:anonymous@cvs.engr.valinux.com:/cvs/rh-vale

product:va-redhat-os-7.1.1

Comments are supported as in the first line.  The 'name' entry is the actual
name of the product.  'cvsroot' is used to check the product out to build
it.

The interesting things happen after this header.  'product' is a keyword which
pulls in another product.  In this case it is 'va-redhat-os-7.1.1'.

Skimming the va-redhat-os-7.1.1 file we see lines like this:

product:kernel ver=2.4.3-srpm
module:lilo tag=head

the kernel line uses the 'ver' option which specifies what version of the
product kernel to use.

the module line explains how to check the item out of the revision control
system.

Now this:
contrib-rh-7.1/anacron-2.3-16.src.rpm bins=bin-rh-7.1/anacron

is another form of the module line above.  It says check the anacron srpm out
of the contrib-rh-7.1 repositiry, but use the compiled rpm (the bins line) if
one is available.  Without the bins line the srpm would be checked out and
compiled with the resulting rpm used in the product.
