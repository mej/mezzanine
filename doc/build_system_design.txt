This document describes the philosophies and strategies behind the
design of the VA Software Engineering Build System.  Hopefully, by
establishing and documenting policies, procedures, and priorities up
front, the resultant product will better suit the needs of all
concerned:  users, administrators, and customers.

The Build System is the collection of all the various tools, including
servers, scripts, etc., which are used in concert to create software
products.  Avalon refers to the set of custom tools which simplify and
streamline the process of using the Build System and are generally
considered a part, though not the whole, of the Build System itself.

1.  PROJECT GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------

Before we design the system, we need to establish a clear set of
guidelines for what it must be able to do.  These are not only
priorities of design, but absolute requirements for the finished
product.  Anything else is simply a benefit, not a necessity.

 - The Build System must create software products.  It must be able to
   create these products in a commonly-acceptable complete form, such
   as a CD image, which can be marketed to customers.
 - The Build System must also be capable of creating package
   collections suitable for use with Build-to-Order Software, either
   as an intermediate step of the above, or in its own right.
 - The Build System must preserve each state of each product
   permanently.  In other words, it should be possible at any point in
   time to retrieve a particular product which was released at any
   previous point in time.
 - The Build System should enforce good structure and policy for
   maintaining products and packages.  That is, it should do its best
   to assert proper, logical organization amongst all products and
   within each product.
 - The Build System should be robust enough to be as tolerant of
   mistakes as possible.  Specifically, violations of policy should be
   handled as sanely as they can be, but should not be allowed to
   happen directly.
