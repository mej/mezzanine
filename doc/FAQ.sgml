      <question>
        <para>What is &MZ;?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          &MZ; is a set of tools, mostly written in Perl, which
          simplify and expedite the tasks involved with creating and
          maintaining a software product.  This is mostly used in the
          creation of the underground Linux distribution called
          Vermillion, but it can be applied to any product of any nature
          or size.
        </para>
        <para>
          Currently only RPM/SRPM packages are supported, along with
          &MZ;'s own custom SPM and FST formats for helping RPM and CVS
          work together well.  Further, it has only been tested with Red
          Hat's distribution of Linux, but in theory it should work with
          any RPM-based distro.

      <question>
        <para>Who wrote &MZ;?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          &MZ; was written by Michael Jennings, also known as "KainX" on
          IRC and "mej" via e-mail or in person.  He is also responsible
          for Eterm, a terminal emulator for the X Window System; libast,
          a small library of handy functions; and Vermillion, the custom
          RedHat-based Linux distribution.

      <question>
        <para>Why should I use it?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          &MZ; makes maintaining software packages much easier.
          Specifically, it automates the processes of importing packages
          into source code control, creating patch files for changes to
          the base source, building products and their component packages,
          creating installation media for products, and so forth.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you have a RedHat-based Linux system and have tried
          downloading and building SRPM's from other places, you have
          likely experienced the difficulty of patching the source and
          adding those patches to the SRPM.  &MZ; makes this very
          easy.

      <question>
        <para>Why Red Hat and not Debian/Slackware/SuSe?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          Well, there are two answers to this question, really.  The first
          answer explains why I originally went with RedHat.  After using
          Debian for awhile at 3Com and when I first arrived at VA Linux,
          I grew extremely annoyed and frustrated with dselect, dpkg, and
          apt.  VA was still selling servers back then, and they all came
          pre-loaded with a custom version of RedHat.
        </para>
        <para>
          When my frustration level finally reached critical, I switched
          over to VA's custom distro (VA Linux 6.1.1 at the time).  I
          never looked back.  It worked exactly the way I wanted it to,
          and it took me no time at all to learn the in's and out's of RPM
          packaging.
        </para>
        <para>
          Eventually, I began maintaining VA's distro myself.  It soon got
          a name change due to RedHat lawyers throwing a hissy fit; it was
          henceforth known as "Red Hat Linux with VA Linux Enhancements,"
          or "RH-VALE."  (It was originally "RH/VALE," but you can't use
          '/' in filenames....)
        </para>
        <para>
          Now, for the second part of this question:  Why did I stick with
          RedHat?  The RPM-based philosophy is far more compatible with
          this type of development.  The Debian community, especially the
          group of developers, are largely zealots who do not feel that
          individuals or small groups should be creating and releasing
          their own .deb packages.  Furthermore, IMHO, Debian has its head
          fairly well entrenched in RMS's posterior; RMS has long since
          lost sight of the true vision and goal, preferring instead to
          focus on ego-centric concerns, and I refuse to be party to his
          religious activism.
        </para>
        <para>
          Yes, there are other RPM-based distro's.  I don't really have a
          problem with Linux-Mandrake, as they seem to do a much better
          job at keeping up with package updates in a stable, useable
          manner.  I refuse to use SuSe due to the unfortunate fascist
          nature of its YaST config tool.
        </para>
        <para>
          First and foremost, however, I use RedHat because it's the
          distro with which I am most familiar and about which I have the
          most knowledge and expertise.  In the end, it all boils down to
          that.

      <question>
        <para>Do you plan to support other formats in the future?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>
          There are currently hooks in place for Debian support.  I do not
          use Debian, nor do I use dpkg, so I have no fleshed out the
          backend code for those sections yet.  In theory, it shouldn't be
          too much work; the biggest problem will be the fact that the
          creators of dpkg elected to not have a true source package
          format (a la SRPM).
